    description: 'This warm and stylish home was taken down to the studs and fully remodeled with brand new finishes, features and fixtures throughout. BRAND NEW roof, water heater, windows, HVAC system and more — this home lives like new construction! Conveniently located in Ruby Hill and just a stone’s throw away from Platt Park and Washington Park, this 3 bed/2 bath home has all the perks of Denver city living, but with plenty of space to roam. Drenched in natural light, the main floor offers vaulted ceilings and a spacious open floor plan, as well as the primary bedroom and bathroom. The finished basement has a second living space, 2 conforming bedrooms, a full bath, plus a separate laundry room. Though there is already a private off-street parking spot just behind the home, zoning allows for a detached garage to be built in the future (buyer to verify). Other exterior features of this corner-lot home include a covered patio, professional landscaping, a storage shed and a new privacy fence. Take a stroll to the end of the cul-de-sac to find the Sanderson Gulch Trail leading you to historic Ruby Hill Park and the Levitt Pavilion, the first and only free cultural venue in Denver that hosts free concerts all summer long. Don’t miss out on owning your own slice of paradise in this up-and-coming south Denver neighborhood!',
